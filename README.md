# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
<p><strong>Sorting Algorithm visualizer</strong> is an algorithm that enables a user to view each step happening during the execution of sorting algorithms. Data visualization is an easy form of understanding a concept and it is very important for research work as well. This algorithm serves both purposes. A fun fact about this project is, it not only shows the steps, but it also visualizes the data as charts.<p>
